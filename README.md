# PyBer_Challenge

## Overview & Purpose
This project has been undertaken to create visualizations of rideshare data for the company PyBer in order to help improve access to ride sharing services and help the management determine affordability for underserved neighbourhoods. A summary dataframe of the ride sharing data by city type has been created using Python from the CSV files available at Pyber and then a multiple line graph has been created using the Matplotlib library to show the total weekly fares for ach city type.The data has been analyzed on the basis of three city types-
- Urban
- Suburban
- Rural

## Results

### Summary DataFrame

![](images/pyber_summary.png)

- The total number of rides in the urban cities are 13 times higher than that of rural cities and 2.6 times higher compared to suburban cities.
- The total number of drivers are almost 31 times higher than that of rural cities and 4.9 times higher compared to suburban cities.
- Urban cities generate the highest revenue ($39,854.38), which is twice the revenue generated by suburban cities ($19,356.33) and 9.2 times the revenue generated by rural cities.
- The average fare per ride is highest in rural cities($34.62) followed by suburban cities ($30.97). The average fare per ride in urban cities ($24.53) is almost 1.4 times lower than rural cities and almost 1.2 times lower than the suburban cities.
- Since the average fare per ride is higher in rural cities compared to the other city types and the number of drivers are much lesser, the average fare per driver is also the highest ($55.49) in rural cities compared to suburban cities ($39.50) and rural cities ($16.57) where the number of drivers are the highest and the average fare per ride is the lowest.
